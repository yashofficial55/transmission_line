# transmission_line
Have you noticed outside those big giant towers similar to Eiffel Tower...that's the transmission line tower you see..
It(Transmission Line) is a specialized cable or other structure designed to conduct electromagnetic waves in a contained manner. The term applies when the conductors are long enough that the wave nature of the transmission must be taken into account. This applies especially to radio-frequency engineering because the short wavelengths mean that wave phenomena arise over very short distances (this can be as short as millimetres depending on frequency)..






So here are results of code I just created...
